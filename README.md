# HUMIDITY

## AUTHOR
Neville Oronni

## DESCRIPTION
The page displays a form for a user to enter the name of a city. When they click a button, we are going to use jQuery to make an AJAX request in the background to the Open Weather Map API. We will then display the current humidity for that city. We can link to this page by adding an anchor tag to our pingpong app's index.html page.
